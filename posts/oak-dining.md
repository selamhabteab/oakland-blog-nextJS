Before I tell you my favorite restaurants in Oakland, I'll need to share the factors I weigh in. Afterwards, I'll organize my top picks by context! You'll see.  

**Factors** include: 
1. Ambiance for both indoor and outdoor dining! Restaurants that never offered outdoor dining before but must adapt to the pandemic have constructed on-street patios that can either be quite nice or really uncomfortable. 
2. Quality of meal and taste. You know when a restaurant doesn't use in season/fresh ingredients.
3. Price -- if the meal is mediocre but the price is superb then we have a problem. Or if the meal is amazing and the price is affordable then we have a winner!
4. Accessability -- Is there a really long wait-time? Are the staff welcoming? Is parking terrible?  

**Context:** No one can determine a favorite restaurant without some context.
